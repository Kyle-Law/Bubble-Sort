# Bubble Sort

The first collaborative Ruby project of the Microverse Software Development Program between [@Kyle-Law](https://github.com/Kyle-Law) and [@tirthajyoti-ghosh](https://github.com/tirthajyoti-ghosh), where we have to build two methods - #bubble_sort and #bubble_sort_by that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology.

For #bubble_sort_by, it sorts an array by accepting a block and the usage of 'yield' is required.

## Built With

- Ruby
- VS Code
